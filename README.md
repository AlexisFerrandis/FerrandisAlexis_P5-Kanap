## Fifth project with Openclassrooms

For this project, the front and the back are provided. The work was to dynamically integrate the elements of the API in the various web pages with JavaScript and set up an acceptance test plan.

###Challenges 

* The web application will consist of 4 pages:
* A home page showing (dynamically) all the articles available at
the sale.
*  A “product” page which displays (dynamically) the details of the product on
which the user clicked from the home page. From this page, the user
can select a quantity, a color, and add the product to his basket.
* A “shopping cart” page. This contains several parts:
○ A summary of the products in the cart, the total price and the possibility of
modify the quantity of a selected product or delete it.
○ A form for placing an order. Data from
form must be correct and well formatted before being returned to the
back-end. For example, no number in a first name field.
* A “confirmation” page:
○ An order confirmation message thanking the user for his
order, and indicating the order ID sent by the API.
